## <a name="usage"></a>How to build your own app using the template project
### üì≤ Setup
1. Download the latest release of template project (not beta) here: [https://github.com/travelpayouts/travel-app-ios/releases](https://github.com/travelpayouts/travel-app-ios/releases).
Alternatively you can clone the repository for development.
2. Download dependencies via ```pod install --repo-update``` command in Terminal. Do not forget to ```cd``` to the template project folder. **Use the ```TravelpayoutsTravelApp.xcworkspace``` to work with your project**.
3. Add your partner's token and marker in ```TravelpayoutsTravelApp/default_config.plist``` file to parameters ```partner_marker``` and ```api_token```.
4. If you don't have partner marker and API token, please sign up on [Travelpayouts](https://travelpayouts.com/).
5. Change app name in files ```Info.plist``` and ```LaunchScreen.xib```.
6. Use the ```default_config.plist``` config file to enable/disable flights/hotels tabs, to add app description, feedback email, app website link and App Store app link for the "About" page and to add localized values for external links.
### üì± iOS versions support
Application supports iOS 10.0 and higher
### üñº App Icon
**Do not forget to replace app icons** (Template project includes simple white icons by default). To do this you will need to replace icons in ```TravelpayoutsTravelApp/AppIcon.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset``` folder (20.png, 29.png, 40.png etc) with your own icons with same names.
### ‚úàÔ∏èüè® Tab selection
If you want to remove flights or hotels search tab, change values of ```flights_enabled``` and ```hotels_enabled``` to NO in Project settings. Information tab can't be removed this way.
### üîßüåª Color customization
You can choose color scheme in ```ColorSchemeManager.swift``` file. Just add to ```current``` variable one of these values: BlackColorScheme() / PurpleColorScheme(). Or set CustomColorScheme() value and set up any color scheme you need in ```CustomColorScheme.swift``` file.
Here is a list of primary fields with explanations:

|Title|Description|
|--------|--------|
mainColor | Primary app color
actionColor | Actions highlight color

Fine-grained color customization can be configured in file ```ASTJRC.swift``` by overriding colors from the base class ```JRC```.
### ü§ë Appodeal ads setup
To get additional profit from ads, we've integrated Mobile Ads [Appodeal SDK](https://www.appodeal.com/) in the app. To configure it, specify the ```appodeal_key``` parameter in the ```default_config.plist``` file (get your API key by registering at [Appodeal](https://www.appodeal.com/)). Ads will appear on the waiting screens for tickets and hotels searching by default.
### ‚≠êÔ∏è Feedback
Set up the ```feedback_email``` and ```itunes_link``` parameters in ```default_config.plist``` file to activate "Contact us" and "Rate this app" links.
The recommended format for ```itunes_link``` is the following: ```https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1234567890?action=write-review```, where ```id1234567890``` is the identifier of a published application.
## üè≠ **Use of Firebase**
Template app supports **Firebase** services. To enable them, please connect your app in the Firebase console, download and copy with replacement the **GoogleService-Info.plist** file to ```TravelpayoutsTravelApp``` folder and switch the **firebase_enabled** flag to **YES** in the **default_config.plist** file. Out of the box there is an analytics support for: Search / Ticket opened / Ticket booked in the airlines part and Search / Hotel opened / Hotel booked in the hotels part of the app.
